# Ali Alhashem's Portfolio

A responsive, lightweight personal portfolio website built as part of the Web Development Assignment 1. This project showcases my skills in HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox), and Vanilla JavaScript.



## 🚀 Features
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop using CSS Flexbox.
* **Dark Mode Toggle:** A custom-built theme switcher that remembers user preferences via `localStorage`.
* **Smooth Navigation:** Seamless scrolling between sections using the JavaScript `scrollIntoView` API.
* **Modern Contact Form:** A clean, stylized form with built-in HTML5 validation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for better accessibility and SEO.
* **CSS3:** Custom styles using Flexbox for a "Mobile-First" layout.
* **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS for interactivity and persistent theme states.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html`: The main entry point of the website.
* `css/styles.css`: All styling, including mobile-first media queries.
* `js/script.js`: Interactivity logic and theme management.
* `docs/`: Contains technical documentation and the AI usage report.
